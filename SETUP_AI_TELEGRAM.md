# AI Research & Telegram Notifications Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the new AI-powered research and Telegram notification features for your business card CRM.

## Overview

Your enhanced business card CRM now includes:
- **AI Research**: Uses Google Gemini to automatically research people and companies from business cards
- **Telegram Notifications**: Sends research summaries directly to your Telegram account
- **Enhanced Database**: Stores research data for future reference

## Prerequisites

1. **Google AI Studio Account** - for Gemini AI research
2. **Telegram Bot** - for notifications
3. **PostgreSQL Database** - already configured

## Step 1: Get Google Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Get API Key" 
4. Create a new API key or use an existing one
5. Copy the API key (starts with `AIza...`)

## Step 2: Create Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
2. Start a chat and send `/newbot`
3. Follow the prompts to create your bot:
   - Choose a name (e.g., "Business Card CRM Bot")
   - Choose a username (e.g., "your_crm_bot")
4. Copy the bot token provided by BotFather
5. **Get your Chat ID**:
   - Send a message to your new bot
   - Visit: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
   - Find your chat ID in the response (usually a positive number)

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Add these new variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Existing variables
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_url
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000

# NEW: AI Research Configuration
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# NEW: Telegram Bot Configuration  
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id_here
```

## Step 4: Install Dependencies & Run Migration

```bash
# Install new dependencies
npm install

# Run database migration to add research_data column
npm run migrate

# Verify the migration worked
npm run check-schema
```

## Step 5: Test the Setup

### Test Telegram Integration
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app-url.com/admin/test-telegram" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Test AI Research
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app-url.com/admin/test-ai-research" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Step 6: Start Your Server

```bash
npm start
```

You should see these startup messages:
```
‚úÖ AI Research Service initialized
‚úÖ Telegram Notification Service initialized
```

## How It Works

### Enhanced Business Card Processing

When you scan a business card with your iPhone shortcut:

1. **Data Processing**: Contact info is cleaned and validated (as before)
2. **AI Research**: Gemini analyzes the person/company and generates insights
3. **Database Storage**: Contact + research data saved to PostgreSQL
4. **Telegram Notification**: Summary sent to your Telegram

### What Gets Researched

The AI will research:
- **Professional Background**: Current role, career history
- **Company Analysis**: Business model, market position, recent news
- **Industry Insights**: Trends, challenges, opportunities  
- **Business Opportunities**: Potential collaborations
- **Communication Strategy**: How to approach this contact
- **Recent Activities**: News, publications, speaking events

### Telegram Notification Format

You'll receive messages like:
```
üîó New Business Card Scanned

üë§ Contact Details:
‚Ä¢ Name: John Smith
‚Ä¢ Company: Tech Corp
‚Ä¢ Industry: Software

```

## API Endpoints

### New Research Endpoints

- `GET /contacts/:id/research` - Get research data for a contact
- `POST /contacts/:id/research` - Run AI research for existing contact
- `POST /admin/test-telegram` - Test Telegram integration
- `POST /admin/test-ai-research` - Test AI research

### Enhanced Process Card

Your existing `/process-card` endpoint now automatically:
- Runs AI research
- Sends Telegram notifications
- Stores research data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI Research Not Working**
   - Check `GEMINI_API_KEY` is correct
   - Verify you have Gemini API access
   - Check API quotas in Google AI Studio

2. **Telegram Not Working**
   - Verify `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is correct
   - Check `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` is your actual chat ID
   - Make sure you've started the bot

3. **Database Issues**
   - Run `npm run check-schema` to verify schema
   - Re-run `npm run migrate` if needed

### Error Messages

- "AI Research service not available" ‚Üí Check GEMINI_API_KEY
- "Telegram service not available" ‚Üí Check bot token/chat ID
- "research_data column doesn't exist" ‚Üí Run migration

## Cost Considerations

### Google Gemini API
- Gemini 1.5 Flash is cost-effective for this use case
- Estimate: ~$0.01-0.05 per business card research
- Monitor usage in Google AI Studio

### Telegram Bot
- Free for personal use
- No additional costs

## Privacy & Security

- Research data is stored securely in your PostgreSQL database
- API keys should be kept secure and not shared
- Research uses only publicly available information
- Telegram messages are encrypted

## Next Steps

1. Test with a few business cards to verify everything works
2. Monitor research quality and adjust prompts if needed
3. Consider adding research data to your CRM dashboard
4. Set up monitoring/alerts for API usage

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the server logs for error messages
2. Test individual components (AI, Telegram) separately
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Ensure database migration completed successfully
